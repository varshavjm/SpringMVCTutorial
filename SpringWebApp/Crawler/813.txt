To start off your drawing experience, consider drawing the most basic shape â€” a line. A canvas when viewed upon with regards to drawing routines can be expressed as an inverted Cartesian coordinate system. A plane expressed by an x- and a y-axis. The origin point or ( 0 , 0 ) {\displaystyle (0,0)} being the top-left corner of a canvas and the visible area of the canvas being the Cartesian quadrant I or the positive-positive (+,+) quadrant. The further you go down from the top, the greater the value of y-coordinate on the y-axis, vice-versa for the x-axis as you move toward the right from the left. And unlike the values on a normal graph, the values appear to be positive. So a point at ( 10 , 20 ) {\displaystyle (10,20)} would be 10 pixels away from the left and 20 pixels away from the top, hence the format ( x , y ) {\displaystyle (x,y)} .
