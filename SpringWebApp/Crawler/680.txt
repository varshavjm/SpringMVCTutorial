After J2EE, Sun had a vision about the next step of network computing: in a network environment, there would be many independent services and consumers. That is JavaSpaces. JavaSpaces would allow these services/consumers to interact dynamically with each other in a robust way. It can be viewed as an object repository that provides a distributed persistent object exchange mechanism (persistent can be in memory or disk) for Java objects. It can be used to store the system state and implement distributed algorithms. In a JavaSpace, all communication partners (peers) communicate by sharing state. It is an implementation of the Tuple spaces idea.
