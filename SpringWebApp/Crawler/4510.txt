The example1, example2 and example3 methods will cause compile errors. The example1 methods cannot co-exist because they have the same signature (remember, return type is not part of the signature). The example2 methods cannot co-exist because the names of the parameters are not part of the signature. The example3 methods cannot co-exist because the visibility of the methods are not part of the signature. The example4 methods can co-exist, because they have different method signatures.
