But consider for a moment that the execution of a particular statement is expected to take a considerable amount of time. You do not want to keep the CPU on halt until the statement gets executed and done with; you would want the CPU to continue with some other application process and resume the current application as smoothly as possible after its statement is executed. It can only be possible if you can run several processes simultaneously, such that when one process is executing a statement that is expected to take some time, another process in the queue would continue doing other things and so on. Such a principle of programming is called concurrent programming.
