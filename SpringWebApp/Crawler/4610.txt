This method works but object creation with the new keyword is time-consuming. The clone() method copies the whole object's memory in one operation and this is much faster than using the new keyword and copying each variable so if you need to create lots of objects with the same type, performance will be better if you create one object and clone new ones from it. See below a factory method that will return a new object using cloning.
