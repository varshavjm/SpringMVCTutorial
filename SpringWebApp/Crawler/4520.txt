Although a method signature has to be unique inside a class, the same method signature can be defined in different classes. If we define a method that exists in the super class then we override the super class method. It is called method overriding. This is different from method overloading. Method overloading happens with methods with the same name but different signature. Method overriding happens with methods with the same name and same signature between inherited classes.
