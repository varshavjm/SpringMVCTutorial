Reusability comes at the core of any modern computer language's framework. It is often desirable to use components you previously built in recurring environments. In Rapid Application Development, these prove more helpful as you can drag them off a list of components and use it elsewhere in your project. Such level of reusability is added into the Java Programming language with the help of the JavaBeans architecture.
