When an object is garbage-collected, the programmer may want to manually perform cleanup, such as closing any open input/output streams. To accomplish this, the finalize() method is used. Note that finalize() should never be manually called, except to call a super class' finalize method from a derived class' finalize method. Also, we can not rely on when the finalize() method will be called. If the java application exits before the object is garbage-collected, the finalize() method may never be called.
