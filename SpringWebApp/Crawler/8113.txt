Up until now, you have been able to draw a simple rectangle for yourself while asking a question silently, "why is the outline of the rectangle being painted rather the area as a whole?" The answer is simple. Any method that starts with drawXxxx(...) only draws the outline. To paint the area within the outline, we use the fillXxxx(...) methods. For instance, the code below would fill a rectangle with yellow color while having a red outline. Notice that the arguments remain the same.
