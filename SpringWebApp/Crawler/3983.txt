The synchronization is always associated to an object. If the method is static, the associated object is the class. If the method is non-static, the associated object is the instance. While it is allowed to declare an abstract method as synchronized, it is meaningless to do so since synchronization is an aspect of the implementation, not the declaration, and abstract methods do not have an implementation.
