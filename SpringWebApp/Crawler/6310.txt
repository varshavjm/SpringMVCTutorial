Creating threads is as simple as the above program suggests. You just have to create an object of the Thread class and pass a reference to a Runnable process object. In the case above, we present the Thread constructor with the class object for the RunnableProcess class that we created in code listing 1. But for each object, we give a different name (i.e., "Thread-1" and "Thread-2", etc.) to differentiate between the three Thread objects. The above example only declares Thread objects and hasn't yet started them for execution.
