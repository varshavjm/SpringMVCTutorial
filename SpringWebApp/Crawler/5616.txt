You can also use the java.lang.Throwable class here, since Throwable is the parent class for the application-specific Exception classes. However, this is discouraged in Java programming circles. This is because Throwable happens to also be the parent class for the non-application specific Error classes which are not meant to be handled explicitly as they are catered for by the JVM itself.
