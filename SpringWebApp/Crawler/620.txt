In computer programming, an application program runs in a certain process of the CPU. Every statement that is then executed within the program is actually being executed in that process. In essence, when a statement is being executed, the CPU focuses all its attention on that particular statement and for the tiniest fraction of a second puts everything else on hold. After executing that statement, the CPU executes the next statement and so forth.
