Notice that the syntax of the drawRoundRect(int, int, int, int, int, int) method is a bit different than the syntax for the simple rectangle drawing routine drawRect(int, int, int, int). The two new arguments added at the end are the width of the arc in pixels and the height of the arc in pixels. The result is pretty amazing when you run the program. You don't need to squint your eyes to tell that the corners of the rectangle are slightly rounded. The more the values of the width and height of the arcs, the more roundness appears to form around the corner.
