There is also Reader which is an abstract class that represents a source of character data. It is analogous to InputStream, except that it deals with characters instead of bytes (remember that Java uses Unicode, so that a character is 2 bytes, not one). Its methods are generally similar to those of InputStream. Concrete subclasses include classes like FileReader, which reads characters from files, and StringReader, which reads characters from strings. You can also convert an InputStream object to a Reader object with the InputStreamReader class, which can be "wrapped around" an InputStream object (by passing it as an argument in its constructor). It uses a character encoding scheme (which can be changed by the programmer) to translate a byte into a 16-bit Unicode character.
