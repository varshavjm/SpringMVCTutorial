When an object from the MyObject class is created for the first time, the JVM searches the file system for the definition of the class, that is the Java byte code. The file has the extension of *.class. The CLASSPATH environment variable contains locations where Java classes are stored. The JVM is looking for the MyObject.class file. Depending on which package the class belongs to, the package name will be translated to a directory path.
