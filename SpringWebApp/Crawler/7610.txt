Output Streams direct streams of bytes outwards to the environment from our program or application. OutputStream is an abstract class which is the destination counterpart of InputStream. OutputStream has a write() method which can be used to write a byte to the stream. The method is overloaded, and can take an array as well. A close() method closes the stream when the application is finished with it, and it has a flush() method. The stream may wait until it has a certain amount before it writes it all at once for efficiency. If the stream object is buffering any data before writing it, the flush() method will force it to write all of this data. Like InputStream, this class cannot be instantiated, but has concrete subclasses that parallel those of InputStream, eg ByteArrayOutputStream, FileOutputStream, etc.
