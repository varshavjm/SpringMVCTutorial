Aside from the java.util.Collection interface, the Java JDK has the java.util.Map interface as well. It is sometimes also called an Associated Array or a Dictionary. A map defines key value mappings. Implementations of the Map interface do not contain collections of objects. Instead they contain collections of key->value mappings. It can be thought of as an array where the index doesn't need to be an integer.
