There are three overloaded versions of the wait method to support different ways to specify the timeout value: java.lang.Object.wait(), java.lang.Object.wait(long) and java.lang.Object.wait(long, int). The first method uses a timeout value of zero (0), which means that the wait does not timeout; the second method takes the number of milliseconds as a timeout; the third method takes the number of nanoseconds as a timeout, calculated as 1000000 * timeout + nanos.
