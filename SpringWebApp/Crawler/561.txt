Such exceptional code that results in erroneous interpretations at program runtime usually results in errors that are called exceptions in Java. When the Java interpreter encounters an exceptional code, it halts execution and displays information about the error that occurs. This information is known as a stack trace. The stack trace in the above example tells us more about the error, such as the thread — "main" — where the exception occurred, the type of exception — java.lang.ArithmeticException, a comprehensible display message — / by zero, and the exact methods and the line numbers where the exception may have occurred.
