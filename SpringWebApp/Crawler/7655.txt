The java.lang.Object.equals(java.lang.Object) method compares the object to another object and returns a boolean result indicating if the two objects are equal. Semantically, this method compares the contents of the objects whereas the equality comparison operator "==" compares the object references. The equals method is used by many of the data structure classes in the java.util package. Some of these data structure classes also rely on the Object.hashCode methodâ€”see the hashCode method for details on the contract between equals and hashCode. Implementing equals() isn't always as easy as it seems, see 'Secrets of equals()' for more information.
