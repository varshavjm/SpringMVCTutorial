The code section 3.92 is comparing the String variable person1 to person2. If person1 is different even in the slightest manner, we will get a value above or below 0 depending on the exact difference. The result is negative if this String object lexicographically precedes the argument string. The result is positive if this String object lexicographically follows the argument string. Take a look at the Java API for more details.
