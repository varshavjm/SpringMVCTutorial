Note that C++ JNI code is syntactically slightly cleaner than C JNI code because like Java, C++ uses object method invocation semantics. That means that in C, the env parameter is dereferenced using (*env)-> and env has to be explicitly passed to JNIEnv methods. In C++, the env parameter is dereferenced using env-> and the env parameter is implicitly passed as part of the object method invocation semantics.
